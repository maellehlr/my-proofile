       	<h2>My future projects and ambitions ☘️</h2>
        <p> 
	      In the future I would like to spend one year abroad during my studies, in order to acquire a good level in foreign languages,
	      mainly in English and German, two subjects I am presently studing. Having always had a sense of sharing and mutual aid, I would like to participate in humanitarian stays in order to bring my help to people in difficulty and to transmit them my knowledge and to give them my personal objects that I no longer use.
